<h2 id="policy">Course Policies</h2>
<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>All labs for a given week are due on the following week on a Wednesday at 11:59 PM (so yes, a week-and-a-half to do all labs for a week). The new week will be made available on Monday morning at 10 AM. Late labs are not accepted.</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Online Course</h2>
<p>This course will be a fun one for sure. A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>

<h3>1. What this course will NOT have and what I will NOT do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have set office hours.</li>
<li>Require students to meet online during specific times.</li>
<li>Require students to work in teams, a semester group project.</li>
<li>Require students to physical meet at the Tufts Medford Campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many good reasons why I will not do any of the above items:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's summertime.  Many of you have commitments and plans already scheduled (e.g., vacation, dinners, weddings, conferences, family get-togethers).</li>
<li>A number of you are working (full-time or internship).  That's more important as people need to live, eat.</li>
<li>Some students are taking this course abroad.  Thus, there are time zone differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding constraints and extra burden to your lives especially during the summer will not fit well with anyone.  Extra constraints and burden also defeat the purpose of an online course.  Thus, you will probably not see me at all this summer.</p>

<h3>2. You are on your own pace.</h3>
<p>You can choose to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pace yourself during the week</li>
<li>Do everything during the weekend</li>
<li>Do everything during the last minute</li>
<li>Don't do any of the work</li>
</ol>
<p>Your choice, but the latter three choices are not wise.</p>

<h3>3. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
<p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>

<h3>4. You will learn by doing.</h3>
<p>Each week, there will be at most three labs (and a quiz every other week) to hone your skills and to aim at the crux of the matter for the week.  Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks and watching YouTube videos.  You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>

<h3>5. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>

<h3>6. ...and I expect the Piazza board to be very active and civil.</h3>
<p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions.  I will be online constantly, thus the idea of set office hours almost becomes moot point.  It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>

<p>There is a very good post published by Northeastern University: "How To Be a Successful Online Learner."
